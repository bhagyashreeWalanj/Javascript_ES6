ES6 practices


1. Async functions means functions running in parallel with other functions. 
   It can be handled by 2 methods : 
   1. callback methods
   2. Promises
   When using the JavaScript function setTimeout(), 
   you can specify a callback function to be executed on time-out:

2. A Promise is a javascript object thats links "Producing code" and "Consuming code" together. 
    "Producing Code " :  it takes time to produce result by functions 
    "Consuming code ": It wants results to show final output as whether it is success or error  


3. async and await make promises easier to write"
  async makes a function return a Promise
  await makes a function wait for a Promise
